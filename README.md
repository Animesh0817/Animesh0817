👋 Hello, World! I'm Animesh!

🚀 With nearly a decade of experience in developing code for Linux-based systems, I've seen my fair share of projects and common challenges. From custom loggers to IPC libraries, data structure abstractions, and design patterns, I've noticed that many of these components get rewritten across projects. I’m on a mission to change that! 🌱

🔍 In my free time, I’ve started to tackle these problems, sometimes designing solutions from scratch, and other times harnessing the power of Gen-AI tools. My goal is to create reusable, high-quality components that developers can rely on, saving time and effort across projects.

👥 Collaboration is Key!
I'm a developer at heart, but I have a special appreciation for QA teams (yes, really! 😄). I'd love to collaborate with anyone who shares the same passion for crafting robust code, testing new ideas, or just contributing to making development smoother for all.

🎉 Let's Build Something Great Together!
If you're interested in contributing, sharing suggestions, testing, or have new project ideas, join me on this journey! All contributions are welcome, especially if you share the same mindset of building cool stuff in your free time.

Ciao! 👋🚀
